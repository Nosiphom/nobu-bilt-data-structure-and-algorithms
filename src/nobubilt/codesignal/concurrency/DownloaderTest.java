/**
 * In this task, we will run the code you saw in the lesson and observe the output. This will help
 *  you understand how threads can be created and managed concurrently.

You'll see how different download threads are initiated, how the synchronized blocks prevent 
the output messages from overlapping, and how the threads are assigned different priorities 
to demonstrate their impact on scheduling.

Here’s what the code does:

Downloader Class:

Implements the Runnable interface.
Simulates a file download using Thread.sleep().
Prints messages synchronized with System.out to avoid overlapping outputs.
Main Class:

Creates three threads, each with an instance of Downloader for different files.
Assigns unique names and different priorities to each thread.
Starts all threads and ensures the main thread waits for their completion using the join() method.
Run the code to see it in action!
